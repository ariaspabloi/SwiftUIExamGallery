## Features Implemented

### 1. **Navigation and User Interaction**
- Utilized `NavigationView` and `NavigationStack` to manage screen transitions.
- Implemented navigation title updates dynamically based on user input.
- Included toolbar buttons for accessing settings and additional features.

### 2. **Dynamic List of Postcards**
- Created a scrollable list displaying 20 unique postcard entries.
- Designed reusable `PostcardCell` components to ensure consistent styling.
- Alternated background colors for cells using custom color sets (`CreamWhite` and `SoftGray`).

### 3. **Animations**
- Ensured smooth transitions to improve user experience.

### 4. **Persistent Data with AppStorage**
- Utilized `@AppStorage` to:
  - Save the username entered on the main screen.
  - Persist the last visited screen when the app is closed.

### 5. **Customizable Settings View**
- Created a `SettingsView` accessible via a sheet.
- Enabled drag-to-expand behavior with `.presentationDetents` for medium and large modal sizes.

### 6. **Custom Colors and Icons**
- Defined two custom `ColorSet` entries for consistent theming.
- Added an app icon to enhance the project's visual identity.

### 7. **Project Organization**
- Structured code into folders (e.g., `Views`, `Components`, `Models`, `Resources`) for maintainability.
- Adhered to clean code practices for scalability.
